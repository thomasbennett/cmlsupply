Perfect for use when reflowing the GPU during Xbox-360 &quot;Ring Of Death&quot; Repairs</h3>
<p><strong>30 Gram syringe with piston for use with air-powered dispenser</strong></p>
<p>RF741 is a high-viscosity No-Clean paste flux developed to assist in printed circuit board rework or repair. RF741 is an effective paste flux for prototype work where a small amount of flux is needed on a specific area of a board or assembly. After being dispensed, rework flux stays in place until soldering occurs. Exhibits excellent performance in applications requiring a flux having good thermal stability such as surface mount component or repair.</p>
<p>It is the ideal choice for QFP or BGA rework operations. It is also well suited for use with through-hole repair operations.</p>
<p>Residues that remain after soldering are almost colorless, leaving a cosmetically appealing repair. The residue has high electrical resistance is safe to be left on the assembly after soldering.</p>
<div><strong>Features:</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li>High Viscosity- stays where you put it.</li>
    <li>Residues are non-corrosive, so not need to be removed after soldering</li>
    <li>Compatible with most no-clean solders and fluxes.</li>
    <li>Leaves bright/shiny solder joints after reflow</li>
    <li>Lead Free - RoHS compliant.</li>
    <li>May be used with leaded or lead-free solders.</li>
    <li>Stored in a controlled environment</li>
    <li>Labeled with Date of manufacture and expiration date</li>
</ul>

<p>CW8100 is a halogen-free, non-rosin organic Flux Pen that is specifically  designed for rework of conventional and surface mount circuit board assemblies.
